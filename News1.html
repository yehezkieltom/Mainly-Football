									<h2>Peckham Town football match called off after man 'broke player's jaw with punch on pitch'</h2>
									<p>An amateur football match was abandoned after a player's jaw was broken as he was allegedly punched by an opponent on the pitch.</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									Peckham Town midfielder Ali Abdullahi, 25, suffered a broken jaw and a fractured eye socket when he was reportedly punched during the club’s Kent County League clash with Stansfeld Oxford and Bermondsey on Saturday.
								</p>
								<p>
									He was discharged from King's College Hospital on Tuesday having undergone surgery to repair his jaw and is recovering at home where family said he remains in “distress”.
								</p>
								<p>
									Peckham Town chairman and founder Bryan Hall told the Standard his side’s opponents arrived at Pyners Close playing fields “completely pumped up” for the match.
								</p>
								<p>
									He said: “In the 27th minute the referee awarded us the free kick and some of their players kicked off about it. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Describing the moment Mr Abdullahi was hit, Mr Hall added: “He collapsed immediately. Our physios rushed on tried to get him off the pitch and he collapsed again so we knew how serious it was.
								</p>
								<p>
									“There is no place for this in football. We don’t have any history with this group we are just here to play football.”
								</p>
								<p>
									Mr Hall said Peckham players spent hours at Mr Abdullahi’s bedside at Lewisham Hospital following the attack and that he received “thousands” of supportive messages since it took place.
								</p>
								<p>
									He added: “He was a mess. He can’t speak. It was a sad sight. He is a gentle person. He is a big strong boy but he is quietly spoken.”
								</p>
								<p>
									Father-of-two Mr Abdullahi, who used to play for neighbours Dulwich Hamlet, is a self-employed removals man who was due to start work this week.
								</p>
								<p>
									Speaking from the family home, his wife, who did not want to be named, told the Standard: “Alli would like to thank everyone who has shown support to him. The incident has left him in distress. Alli is a very gentle person, he is softly spoken so he can’t believe this has happened to him.
								</p>
								<p>
									“We are just shocked that this kind of behaviour can take place on a football pitch.”
								</p>
								<p>
									An online fundraising page set up by Dulwich Hamlet Supporters' Trust to support Mr Abdullahi as he recovers from his injuries has raised nearly £500.
								</p>
								<p>
									Stansfeld Oxford and Bermondsey chairman Ian Rooney said the club was unable to comment on the incident until it had received the FA’s match report, which is due imminently.
								</p>
								<p>
									A Met police spokesman confirmed a 24-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of GBH.
